<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>I first became interested in studying trends regarding social distancing violations and COVID when I saw the significant impact that strict social distancing policies had on decreasing reported cases of COVID-19 in New York. As a proud New Yorker, I wanted to further explore the links between social distancing violations and COVID-19 statistics. New York City has a large repository of data available, such as 311 violations specific to social distancing, and COVID-19 related deaths, hospitalizations, and cases. I sought out to find if any links exists between these data.</p>

<h2>Information about data</h2>
<p>My code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/setu-m/final_project" class="uri">https://github.com/setu-m/final_project</a>. I downloaded the NYC COVID-19 data containing hospitalizations, deaths, and cases per NYC borough on 10-14-2020 from <a href="https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data" class="uri">https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data</a>. This data further specifies information by race, age, and sex. I downloaded the 311 violations data from the NYC website on 10-14-2020 from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Social-Distancing-Violation-Reports-Mapped/jdvc-m64z" class="uri">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Social-Distancing-Violation-Reports-Mapped/jdvc-m64z</a>. I downloaded a filtered dataset from this site that just had social distancing violations in the past year.</p>
